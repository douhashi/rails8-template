# Guideline

## Top-Level Rules

- Run independent processes concurrently, not sequentially.  
- Think only in English; respond only in Japanese.  
- Use **Contex7 MCP** to check library usage.  
- Save temp design notes as `.tmp` in Markdown.  
- After **Write/Edit**, always verify with **Read**, even if system says “(no content)”.  
- Be critical, not obedient—but stay respectful.
